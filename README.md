# Cricket_Analysis_Dashboard---Gamechanger-Insights

<h1>Project Objective</h1>
The objective of this project is to assist a franchise team owner in forming a competitive T20 cricket team by leveraging data-driven insights. The project aims to analyze players' performance across all cricket formats (T20, ODI, and Test) to identify consistent performers, uncover hidden talents, and optimize team composition.

The analysis will include:

1. Evaluating players' performance metrics (e.g., batting average, strike rate, bowling economy, etc.) across formats.


2. Assessing players' adaptability and fitness for T20 cricket based on their historical data.


3. Identifying key areas of strength and improvement for the franchise team.


4. Visualizing player and team performance insights using Excel and Power BI for informed decision-making.



By the end of the project, the franchise owner will have a comprehensive understanding of players' capabilities and actionable insights for building a strong T20 team.
